An interactive, story based game to educate you on AI.

The human race became overdependent on AI. An evil organization (aliens) took advantage of this by planting a bug causing big hallucinations and resulting in the end of humanity as we know it.

However, there is still hope. Scientists had created an indestructible orb of mysterious powers from meteorite fragments as a backup in case AI ever went rogue. Unfortunately, the evil organisation knew about this, and figured out how to dismantle the orb to mitigate its powers.

You unknowngly discover the orb in an abandoned alleyway, and decided to take him in, naming him Sidekick. You decide to join helping Sidekick recover his parts to restore his powers.

Now it is up to you and Sidekick to save the world from this evil organisation.
